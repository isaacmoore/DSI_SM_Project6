       "u\"Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life. \\n\\nDoes it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. \\n\\nEverything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. \\n\\nSometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.\\n\\nWhat can I say? This movie is a life changing experience. \\n\\nMakes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.\""

       "u'Honestly I dont think Ive ever seen anything quite like Its A Wonderful Life Does it take me back to that place in my heart that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again Does it remind me of my childhood Christmas in my home No Maybe its just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be Everything about this film is well for lack of better words perfect No question to it any longer the best performance by an actor I have ever seen Its more than just beautiful timeless or fair All of Stewart is revealed Everything coming together for Capra Lionel Barrymore at his best which seems to be his worst Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen And Im pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made Im 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year Ive watched it 3 times since The only movie to ever make me cry I probably wouldnt have all the answers for you if you asked me why Im still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was ReedWhat can I say This movie is a life changing experience Makes me feel good to be alive What a wonderful little world it is And if I waited my entire life it would not be a waste of time'"
