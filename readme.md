### Overview

This week, we learned about ensemble methods and API's. Now's we're going to put these skills, as well as some of the natural language processing skills you learned about in Week 4 to the test. You've been hired by Netflix to examine what factors lead to certain ratings on movies. Given that Netflix does not currently store this type of data, your boss has suggested that you collect ratings and reviews data from IMDB. Netflix is no stranger to machine learning, however:

- Netflix uses random forests and decision trees to predict what types of movies an individual user may like.
- Using unsupervised learning techniques, they are able to continually update suggestions, listings, and other features of it's user interface.
- Netflix, however, hasn't focused on collecting data on the top movies of all time, and would like to add some of them to their offerings based on popularity and other factors.

**Point:** Your boss isn't sure where to start on this project, so your task is to collect the data, properly store it for reference, and construct a random forest to understand what factors contribute to ratings.


#### Project Summary
In this project, we're going to be using two different datasets: one will be directly pulled from an IMDB API, and other will be scraping from various IMDB pages using information previously collected through the API.
